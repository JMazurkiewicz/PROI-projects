# Quadratic equation

Project requirements:

* Create C++ program with 2 or 3 classes
* The main functionality of application is to solve quadratic equation
* Give user an ability to generate an error (memory leak or null pointer dereference)

Solving `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` equation:

```bash
./QuadraticEquation <a> <b> <c> [optional error code]
```

Where `optional error code` is one of:

* `M` - causes memory leak
* `S` - causes segmentation fault

Score: 5/5
