# Complex list

Project requirements:

* Create class that represents complex number with operators:
  * addition operators: `operator+` and `operator+=`
  * subtraction operators: `operator-` and `operator-=`
  * printing operator: `operator<<`
  * comparison operators: `operator==` and `operator!=`
* Create doubly linked list class that can store complex numbers
* List class should implement those operators:
  * direct access operator: `operator[]`
  * addition operators: `operator+` and `operator+=`
  * printing operator: `operator<<`
* Create unit tests for created classes

Score: 15/15
